        alt="female doctor taking notes"> Doctors all over the world are given the stature next to God. It
      happens so mostly because they are lifesavers who work tirelessly for mankind. Moreover, being a doctor is
      considered one of the most sought-after professions. People want their kids to become doctors and they instill
      this dream in them from an early age.</p>
    <p>During the covid pandemic, some called them "Corona Warriers". But due to the virus several doctors, nurses etc
      lost their lives irrespective of age and gender. </p>

      know that these warriors are the real life heroes. Here are some of the doctors who lost thier precious lives
